The package ATS-Postiats-include contains various .h and .cats files needed
for compiling C code generated from ATS source. Normally, there is no need
to install this package explicitly as it is part of the ATS programming
language system.  There are, however, situations where one does not want to
install ATS or have difficulty installing it. Under such situations, one
can install this package so as to compile C code generated from ATS source.
Please note that releasing C code generated from ATS source is considered a
highly effective way of distributing portable software written in ATS.

The package ATS-Postiats-include can also be readily used for
cross-platform development where it is difficult to generate on the source
platform object code needed for an application designed to be running on
some target platform.  Instead, it is more convenient or even necessary to
compile C code on the target platform to generate the needed object code.
For instance, combining ATS with the Xcode platform (on MacOS) can be
handled in such a manner.
