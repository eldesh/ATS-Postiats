The following two examples do not require any custom Makefiles
for dealing with ATS sources. Currently object generation is not
supported in either of these.

hello: (Work in progress) A makefile that can generate C code on a
       platform with ATS, and compile it on a platform *without*
       ATS. However, this example relies on gcc -MM -MF to determine
       which C source files are required, and it is possible that gcc
       -MM may not be portable across platforms due to the C
       preprocesser requiring variants of included files on different
       platforms. 

       The main advantage of this is simple packaging of a single tarball
       that can be built on similar platforms without requiring any
       ATS archives to be installed on the user's part.

hello2: Like hello but relies on all ATS includes being copied over
        from a release, e.g, ATS2-Postiats-include-X.Y.Z.tgz, and 
        does not depend on gcc -MM.

To package portable sources in either of these examples:

make cleanall && make all && make clean

The first step cleans everything.
The second step makes sure everythign builds.
The third step removes any platform-specific executables
(or object code).



As an intermediate in portability between hello and hello2
above, the hello example in doc/EXAMPLE/PORTABLE supports
gcc -E to generate c code that doesn't depend on CATS files.
