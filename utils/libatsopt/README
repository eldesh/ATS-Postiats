# How to build libatsopt.a
#
######

Assume that ATS1 is already installed.
Assume that ATS2-github is checked out, which is
the version of ATS2 stored in the following directory:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Please use the provided Makefile to build libatsopt.a:

make libatsop # the built libatsopt.a depends on libgmp (-lgmp)
make libatsop_min # the built libatsopt.a does not depend on libgmp

After libatsopt.a is successfully built, you can test it by doing

cd TEST
make patsopt # for libatsopt.a without libgmp dependency
make patsopt LIBGMP=-lgmp # for libatsopt.a with libgmp dependency

The generated executable 'patsopt' is just the compiler for ATS2 :)

Cheers!
